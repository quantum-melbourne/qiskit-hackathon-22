# Qiskit Hackathon Melbourne 2022


## Things to do before the hackathon

### Participants

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

### Mentors

#### Project Ideas

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/quantum-melbourne/qiskit-hackathon-22/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.

#### Project Pitch

Prepare a 3 minute project pitch for Day 2. 

#### My team is ready. Let's hack!

The project should have no more than 5 members. Ask a hackathon organiser to remove the label `members wanted` and add the label `group ready`.
