# Qiskit Hackathon Melbourne 2022

## Event Recap
From 4–7 July 2022, around 35 participants from universities all across Melbourne came together to learn about quantum computing and Qiskit in order to get ready for two days of intense hacking. This hybrid in-person and online Qiskit event was a first of its kind for Australia.

The first two days were focused on a series of by speakers from The University of Melbourne, RMIT, Monash, UNSW, Quantum Brilliance and IBM Quantum. Lectures on the first day focused on providing an introduction to quantum computing and Qiskit with an industry panel answering the age old question 'Why Quantum Computing?'. The day finished with a hands on Qiskit Blocks Social Challenge: a fun Minecraft style escape room game to learn about quantum circuits.

The second day is where the participants started to get their hands dirty learning about applications of quantum computing, starting with quantum machine learning topics. 

In the afternoon, an overview of each Qiskit Application module (Finance, Nature, Machine Learning and Optimisation) was given so participants had a greater understanding of how to use these modules for their hackathon projects. Participants then had the opportunity to test their knowledge of these modules by solving four problems in the Qiskit Challenge Melbourne - a challenge similar to that of the Qiskit Fall Challenge 2021. 

To end the day, a team of mentors from universities across Melbourne came to pitch their hackathon project ideas to everyone. If there was a project that caught your eye, you could join that group, otherwise everyone was free to propose their own unique idea. 

The next two days were spent eagerly hacking away. On the final day of the hackathon, teams presented their project in a series of 3 minute pitches, in an attempt to win over the judges on the four judging criteria: Originality, Usefulness, Community Benefit and Presentation. The project that ultimately captivated both the judges and the community was 'Expressing Quantum Computation Through Generated Art'. This team created a Python library that transforms your quantum circuit into a piece of music.

## Things to do before the hackathon

### Participants

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

### Mentors

#### Project Ideas

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/quantum-melbourne/qiskit-hackathon-22/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.

#### Project Pitch

Prepare a 3 minute project pitch for Day 2. 

#### My team is ready. Let's hack!

The project should have no more than 5 members. Ask a hackathon organiser to remove the label `members wanted` and add the label `group is ready`.
